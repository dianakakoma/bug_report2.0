Bug Report allows a user of your software to create a bug report or feature request, and then submit it to you with a screenshot and relevant URL.

User Story
As a user, I want to be able to submit bug reports or feature requests easily and quickly.

Road Map
This MVC/CRUD application is going to make it easier for end-users to make actionable bug reports by easily incorporating the URL with the issue as well as allowing the user to include a screenshot of the issue.
In addition to bug reports, this application allows users to make feature requests while using the software. Again the URL will be captured and the user can upload a photo that supports their request.
This backend is built in Rails with a PostgreSQL database and RSpec testing. I also created the models and controllers and seeded the database. This week I completed the backend by building out the MVC structure, and tested the routes, controllers and views with Insomnia. In the next few days I will complete complete the Vue.js frontend for a minimally viable product. 
Next week, I will deploy the backend and frontend to Heroku and create upload functionality for the screeenshot. The following week I will create a Chrome extension to import the URL.
